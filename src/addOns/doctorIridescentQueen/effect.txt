Any Survivor struck by the Shock Therapy or Static Blast special abilities acquires a lingering Static Charge. The Static Charge remains with the Survivor until discharge.
Multiple Survivors struck by the same Shock Therapy or Static Blast special ability, that are within 4 metres of each other, do not acquire a Static Charge.
Any time a Survivor is within 4 metres of another Survivor carrying a Static Charge, the Survivor receives a shock identical to a Shock Therapy Attack and the Static Charge is discharged immediately.
