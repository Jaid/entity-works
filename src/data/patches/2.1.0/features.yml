- Added progress bar to emblem tooltips
- Integrated additional Status Effect score notification for the Vigil and Decisive Strike perks
- "Integrated the Proficiency System to interaction progress bars from other players. For example, when a player is being healed by a different player, while a healing debuff perk is active (ie: {coulrophobia}), they will see the debuff applied in their HUD."
