Throughout his years experimenting with anesthetics and muscle relaxants, The Clown developed several effective concoctions and formulas. His favorite, The Afterpiece Tonic, he has used to great effect, intoxicating and capturing many unwilling victims.

• Tap or hold and release the Power button to launch a bottle of The Afterpiece Tonic. On contact, the bottle will break, emitting a gas cloud that will intoxicate any survivors within the area of effect.
