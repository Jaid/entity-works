Evil has a way of always finding you.

After you earn 3 Protection Hit Score Events, Mettle of Man activates.

Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the Dying State from the Injured State is ignored.

The next time you heal back to full health, your Aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are farther than {tiers:12/14/16} metres from the Killer.

Mettle of Man will deactivate the next time you are put into the Dying State.

Increases your chances of being the Obsession.

The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
