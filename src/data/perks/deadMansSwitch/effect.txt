You become obsessed with one Survivor.

After hooking the Obsession, {this} activates for the next {tiers:35/40/45} seconds.

While activated, any Survivor that stops repairing a Generator before it is fully repaired causes The Entity to block the Generator until the effect of {this} ends.

Affected Generators are highlighted by a white Aura.

You can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
