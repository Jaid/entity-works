Your vault speed is {tiers:5%/10%/15%} faster.

Performing a vault action calls upon The Entity to block that vault location for {tiers:8/12/16} seconds.

Only 1 vault location may be blocked in this way at any given time. The vault location is blocked only for Survivors.

Bamboozle does not affect Pallets.
