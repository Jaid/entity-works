The display of your Powers creates a whirlwind of panic that spreads throughout the land.

You become obsessed with one Survivor. Hitting the Obsession with your basic attack causes the Obsession to emit a Terror Radius of 32 metres for 20 seconds. During that time, your Terror Radius is reduced to 0 metres.

This effect can only be triggered once every {tiers:60/45/30} seconds. The Obsession hears the Terror Radius they emit for the duration.

The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
