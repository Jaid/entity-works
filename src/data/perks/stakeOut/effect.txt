Getting close to the Killer fills you with determination.

For each 15 seconds you are standing within the Killer's Terror Radius and are not in a Chase, you gain a Token up to a maximum of {tiers:2/3/4} Tokens.

When Stake Out has at least 1 Token, Good Skill Checks are considered Great Skill Checks and consume 1 Token.
