You start the Trial with a -25% progression penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors.

For every successful Skill Check completed while healing a Survivor, you receive a Token for a maximum of {tiers:3/4/5} Tokens.

Each Token grants you a +15% bonus progression for a successful Skill Check while healing Survivors.

Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using Autodidact.

Autodidact is not active when using a Med-Kit to heal.
