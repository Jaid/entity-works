You start the Trial with 3 Tokens.

When your Aura would be shown to the Killer, the Perk activates and a Token is consumed.

For the next {tiers:6/8/10} seconds while the Perk is activated, your Aura and Scratch Marks will not be shown to the Killer.

Distortion does not activate when you are in the Dying State or affected by Traps.
