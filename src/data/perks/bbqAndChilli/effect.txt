A deep bond with The Entity unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability.

After hooking a Survivor, all other Survivors' Auras are revealed to you for 4 seconds when they are farther than 40 metres from the Hook.

Each time a Survivor is hooked for the first time, gain a 25% stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of {tiers:50%/75%/100%}.

The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-Trial.
