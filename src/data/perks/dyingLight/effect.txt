You become obsessed with one Survivor.

Your Obsession's altruistic action speed is increased by {tiers:38%/44%/50%}.

Once the Obsession is killed or sacrificed, every other Survivor gets a penalty of {tiers:19%/22%/25%} to Repair, Healing and Sabotage speed.

The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
