You become obsessed with one Survivor.

You lurk in the shadows, eliminating your victims one by one.

When your Obsession is hooked, Furtive Chase receives a Token, up to a maximum of {tiers:2/3/4} Tokens.

Each Token decreases your Terror Radius by 4 metres while in a Chase.

When a Survivor rescues the Obsession from a Hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession. You lose all Tokens if the Obsession is sacrificed or killed.

The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
