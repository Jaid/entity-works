A Hex that affects the Survivors' skills at repairing Generators.

All Survivors are affected by Ruin, which causes the following:

Good Skill Checks result in {tiers:3%/4%/5%} regression on the Generator.
Great Skill Checks grant 0% bonus progression on the Generator.

The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.
